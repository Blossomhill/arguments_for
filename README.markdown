# Arguments For More Government

__Check out [the content guidelines](https://www.convinceme.us/content_instructions)__

Arguments that call for an increase in government size, regulation or spending belong here. Arguments for new government also belong here, even if the proposal would hypothetically result in a decrease in government (e.g. school vouchers, where there would potentially, eventually be fewer public schools).

Good arguments do these things:

- Detail _what_ additional government should be
- Explain the goal of the additional government
- Use references to back itself up

Pull Requests can only be merged by the GitHub team members in charge of arguments for more government (they serve as editors).
