# Arguments For More Government

__Check out [the content guidelines](https://www.convinceme.us/content_instructions)__

Arguments that call for an increase in government size, regulation or spending belong here.

Good arguments do these things:

1. Detail _what_ additional government should be
2. Explain the goal of the additional government
3. Use references to back itself up

Pull Requests can only be merged by the GitHub team members in charge of arguments for more government (they serve as editors).
