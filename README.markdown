# Arguments in Favor of Change

- [Info](https://github.com/convinceme/info)
- [content guidelines](https://www.convinceme.us/content_instructions)

Good arguments do these things:

- Detail what the change should be
- Explain the goal of the change
- Use references

The goal is to convince people, not preach to the choir or insult people who believe different things

Pull Requests can only be merged by the GitHub team members in charge of _arguments for_.
